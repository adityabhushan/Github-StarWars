The project is implemented in vanilla JS. 
The reasons for choosing vanilla JS were :
1) No bloatware
2) Demonatrates good understanding of fundamentals
3) Effeciency and speed
4) Easy to undertsand and debug

Used Express - simple web server for server side. However, since the entire code is written on the client side, the project can also be implemented 
by just running index.html with the explicit need for webserver.

For ajax calls `xmlHttpRequest` is used.
